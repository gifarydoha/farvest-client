    "description": "Drying grains has been part of agricultural traditions for thousands of years. This step ensures that crops are preserved so even if it&apos;s not the harvesting season, people will still have food. In today&apos;s setting, drying grains has that same purpose. However, traditional grain drying techniques still have issues that can affect your grains&apos; quality. Mold growth, insect damage, and even loss of germination can all occur if you don&apos;t dry your grains correctly. This is why you have to ensure that harvested grains are properly dried. See some basic tips below on how to do just that: The first basic tip on how to dry grains is to properly prepare them. To do this, you should clean the grains by removing errant materials that may have been mixed in, such as leaves, rocks, or plastic Removing contaminants can decrease the chances of mold or bacterial growth. You should check for spots that may have fungal growth and immediately remove those from your stoc This step is also when you want to make sure that the grains are ready to be dried within 12-24 hours after cutting or harvesting. If the high-moisture grains are stored for too long, there can be an increased chance of bacterial or mold growt 2. Determine how long the grains will be stored. According to the guidelines set by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), the longer grains have to be stored, the lower the moisture content should be. If you store your grains for shorter periods, say a few weeks up to a few months, then a 14% MC or lower would be acceptabl However, if the grains will be stored for longer than a few months, then you should make sure that the moisture content will be lower. A year or more of storage requires moisture content to be at 9 Taking this precaution can prevent problems like insect damage or infestation, loss of seed germination and vigor, and discoloratio Read more: How to prevent rice weevils in commoditi3. Allow ample drying time, especially for patio or sun drying. This will allow the grains to be completely and uniformly dried.

    "description": "Cereal grains such as wheat, corn, and oats are a great source of energy and nutrients like carbohydrates, protein, vitamin E, B vitamins, magnesium, and zinc. Because of this, it’s not surprising that cereals have been a staple in meals, especially breakfast, for many people around the globe in both developed and developing countries.  But before cereal grains reach the breakfast bowls of consumers, they undergo crucial post-harvest management. As everything important requires careful handling, cereal grains, too, need an optimal grain storage system.   Producers, handlers, and traders need to be mindful of this to ensure quality. This can be challenging and may require investment, but the benefits are rewarding.   LONGER SHELF-LIFE OF CEREAL GRAINS   During harvest season, a large number of cereal grains are produced. These grains either need to be consumed before their quality deteriorates or should be stored in a good place for preservation. While the first choice is viable, it is more beneficial to store cereal grains for the long term. This ensures that there is enough supply throughout the year even once the harvest season is over.   However, not all grain storage systems are the same. Some grain storage systems are not equipped to protect the commodities from multiple factors such as insects, pests, and inclement weather. Thus, they do not guarantee a longer shelf-life. Producers, handlers, and traders need to ensure the overall condition of the grain storage system and invest in a good one to enjoy the security of having an ample supply of quality grains even after harvest.   PROTECTION FROM INSECTS AND PESTS   Insects and pests are among the primary causes of damage of cereal grains both before and after harvest.  Insects such as mites and weevils can inhabit grain storage units and produce substances that have an unpleasant taste and smell. Worse is that many of these insects even transmit spores that cause fungal growth, making the cereal grain unsafe for consumption. Toxic substances are found in fungal growth, posing danger to those who consume the tainted commodities.   Aside from harmful substances, insects and pests can also affect the nutritional value of cereal grains. Based on the briefing paper released by the British Nutrition Foundation, insects and pests can decrease the carbohydrate content, increase free fatty acid levels, and affect the vitamin content of cereals. It is said that they can decrease the thiamine content of cereals by 69%, riboflavin content by up to 67%, and niacin by up to 32%. Thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin are B vitamins that help the metabolism.   Therefore, producers, handlers, and traders must ensure that their storage systems prevent insects, pests, and even mold from compromising the precious cereal grains by using airtight containers that can kill off insects in all life stages.   PRESERVATION OF NUTRITIONAL VALUE   Ultimately, good storage conditions should preserve the nutritional value of cereal grains. As discussed, pests and insects can influence the nutritional value of grains—but the problem doesn’t stop there. Changes in moisture inside a storage unit can also deteriorate grain quality.   Cereal grains are stored at an ideal moisture content, but with the lack of good storage conditions, changes may still occur. Once the cereal grains reach a higher-than-ideal moisture content, a breakdown of starch may happen that can eventually lead to a decrease in grain quality. The good news is, that these problems can be prevented by using air- and moisture-tight grain storage solutions.   Enjoy the benefits of having good storage conditions—longer shelf-life, protection from insects and pests, and preservation of nutritional value—by utilizing the right application. GrainPro uses hermetic technology in storing commodities such as cereal grains. Hermetic solutions are proven to help protect cereal grains from insect infestation, mold growth, inclement weather, and more."   },

    "description":"Mold growth in dried food such as grains, maize, or rice is not an appetizing sight. Farmers and handlers detest mold because it means their products are tainted and will most likely result in profit loss.   Annually, around a third of all produced food is lost to several factors, including mold growth. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), around 14% of food valued at an estimated USD400 billion is lost from harvest up to retail and often occurs in the production chain and affects smallholder farmers in developing countries.   FAO estimates that around 30 to 40% of total production is lost before it reaches the market. These losses can be due to numerous problems, which include inadequate post-harvest storage, processing, and transportation facilities.   Aside from the fiscal consequences, mold growth can also lead to serious health risks. Aflatoxins are toxic substances produced by certain molds that can contaminate agricultural commodities like grains. People can be exposed to aflatoxins by consuming contaminated commodities or inhaling dust during processing. These exposures can both have long- and short-term effects.   One such effect is kidney and liver failure. Exposure to aflatoxins is also associated with increasing the risk of liver cancer. Due to the toxicity of aflatoxins, organ failure can occur in humans who consume mold-infested food. Moreover, aflatoxins are also known to be mutagenic, leading to birth defects.   Read more: Reducing health risks through mold growth prevention     Tips to Avoid Molds   These reasons are why farmers and handlers always try to limit the chance of mold growth when storing their crops. It is important in preventing post-harvest and storage losses and ensuring overall safety.   See some tips below to learn how they do it:   First, ensure the grains are at their safe moisture level before storing them. Wet or damp grains are notorious for breeding molds, so it is vital to dry them sufficiently to their safe moisture content (MC) level first. According to FAO, rice can be stored at an MC level of 13.5%, while beans can be at 15%. For wheat and maize, 13.5% can also be a safe level.   Second, it is a good practice to keep external moisture away from the storage container and area. If moisture gets into the stored grains, mold will also begin to grow even if the grains are stored at their safe MC level. Having reliable storage is a must in keeping the grains away from excess moisture due to weather effects such as rain and flood, which can severely damage stocks.   A third tip is to avoid high temperatures in the storage area. If the grains are stored outside, be sure to keep the container in the shade so as not to expose it to direct sunlight. High temperatures can trigger the remaining moisture in the grain to evaporate — leading to condensation and eventually, moisture reabsorption once temperatures lower at night.   Lastly, use gas-tight and moisture-tight storage solutions. This will ensure that the grains are secured and safe from external factors. A secured and safe storage ensures that the grains are protected from moisture damage that can lead to molds. This step also protects the grains’ quality which may be affected by changing moisture levels.   Hermetic storage, like the GrainPro Cocoon, can protect grains from moisture damage and mold growth due to outside factors. Additionally, it can also control insect infestations due to its secured modified atmosphere, which gives it the ability to deprive the insects of the oxygen they need to survive."   },

    "description": "Globally, rice weevil infestations cause damage resulting in losses both in quantity and quality. Agricultural workers try to reduce post-harvest losses through a number of techniques. One of which is by chemical fumigation using phosphine—an internationally accepted fumigant that leaves no traceable residue after the commodities are processed. Commodities are exposed to phosphine for several days so insects inside the storage bins, bags, or silos would be eliminated. Handlers must be careful not to get exposed to the gas because it can potentially cause respiratory problems and other health risks.   Recent studies, however, found that insects like rice weevils are now becoming increasingly resistant to phosphine fumigation. This development serves as a serious threat to protecting agricultural commodities, implicating future difficulties in infestation control. Thus, alternative solutions should be kept in mind, such as the use of hermetic technology.   With this innovative technology, farmers and handlers no longer need to use chemical fumigants for weevil prevention. The airtight and moisture-tight barrier properties of hermetic storage protect commodities from potential damage and prevent pest infestations. If the commodities inside the sealed bags already have insects, they would eventually starve of oxygen and would be eliminated inside the hermetic storage in a matter of days. To hasten this process, controlled atmosphere treatments can also be applied, wherein carbon dioxide is flushed into the sealed storage unit. GrainPro’s hermetic technology is the leading solution to insect control when storing commodities without the need for harmful chemicals. The protective material guards against various insects, including rice weevils, offering secure and safe storage."   }
